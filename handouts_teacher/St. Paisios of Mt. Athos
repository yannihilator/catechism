The Blessed Elder Paisios, whose name in the world was Arsenios Eznepides, was born in the village of Pharasa of Cappadocia on 25 July 1924. Shortly before his family left for Greece with the (forced) Exchange of Populations in 1924, the Elder was baptised by Saint Arsenios the Cappadocian, who gave him his own name, and foretold that he was leaving a (future) monk in his place. Upon arriving in Greece, his family settled in the village of Konitsa, Epeirus, where the Elder spent his childhood and young adult years.

From childhood, he lived an ascetic life. He was nourished by learning about the Lives of the saints, whose feats he sought to imitate with extraordinary zeal and admirable exactitude. He practised unceasing prayer and cultivated the virtues of humility and love. He learned the trade of carpentry, wanting even in this aspect of his life to imitate Christ. He fulfilled his military duty during the Greek Partisan (Guerilla) War (1945-1949). He served for three and a half years in the army as a wireless radio operator, leading an ascetic life even during this troubled time. During this time, he was distinguished for his valour, integrity, self-sacrifice and many other meritorious qualities. After fulfilling his duty to his country, he entered the monastic life, as he had desired from his youth. Even as a layman, he had had divine experiences; but during his monastic life, the favour of the Lord, the Theotokos and the saints intensified. He led an ascetic life on Mount Athos, and in the Holy Monastery of Stomion in Konitsa, and on Mount Sinai in Egypt. He lived in obscurity and gave himself completely to God; and God in turn revealed him and gave him to the whole world. He guided, consoled, healed and granted peace to the multitudes of people who sought his counsel. His sanctified soul overflowed with divine love, and his saintly face radiated divine Grace. All day long, he tirelessly "gathered" the pain of many people and renewed them with divine consolation.

Elder Paisios founded the Holy Monastery of Saint John the Theologian in the village of Souroti of Thessaloniki, Greece, which he also guided spiritually for twenty-eight years (1967-1994). It was to this Holy Monastery that he also entrusted a precious treasure: the holy Relics of his godfather, Saint Arsenios the Cappadocian, to whose memory (St. Arsenios) a church of Byzantine design was later erected on the premises of the monastery.

After suffering excruciating pains (which, as he used to say, benefited him more than all the ascetic struggles of his entire life), he fell asleep in the Lord on 12 July 1994 , in the Holy Monastery of Saint John the Theologian in Souroti, Thessaloniki. He was buried next to the church of Saint Arsenios the Cappadocian.
